# ELEC5552-Portable-Acoustic-Logger

The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline.

# TO DO
- [ ] Create folders responsible for each device
- [ ] Define git formatting rules (e.g. where to define circuit wiring, libraries used, code formatting, etc.)
- [ ] Define work guide (how to create your own branch to work on, when to pull into master)
- [ ] Create plan for who to work on what
- [ ] Allocate people work
- [ ] Get 100% in unit

# Getting your Arduino IDE Setup with Arduino MKR ZERO

1. Install Arduino IDE

2. Adding Arduino MKR Board
- `Tools > Board > Boards Manager >` type "mkr" and install first option

3. Select correct COM Port
- Plug in Arduino
- `Tools > Port >` Select ARDUINO MKRZERO
- if you cannot see use `Device Manager > Ports` to find

4. Run 'Blink' code
- Open `Blink.ino` either from repository or from `File > Examples > Basics > Blink`
- Click Upload and keep an eye on the LED `L`
